                    Living up to its name, Mercury is the fastest planet
                     in the solar system, speeding along at about 29 
                     miles per second and completing each orbit around
                      the sun in just 88 Earth days. Mercury is also the 
                      smallest planet in the solar system, measuring just
                       3,032 miles wide at its equator.
