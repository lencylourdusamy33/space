            Jupiter is covered in swirling cloud stripes.
             It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which
              has been going for hundreds of years. Jupiter is
               a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface, but
                it may have a solid inner core about the size of 
                Earth. Jupiter also has rings, but they're too 
                faint to see very well.

            Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. 
            It is approximately 143,000 kilometers (about 89,000 miles) 
            wide at its equator. Jupiter is so large that all of the
             other planets in the solar system could fit inside it.
              More than 1,300 Earths would fit inside Jupiter

        <div class="box">
          <h2><i class="#"></i>How hot is jupiter?</h2>
          <p>
            It is estimated that the temperature of the cloud tops are 
            about -280 degrees F. Overall, Jupiter's average temperature 
            is -238 degrees F. Since Jupiter is only tilted slightly
             more then 3 degrees on its axis, seasonal fluctuations are minimal.

        <div class="box">
          <h2><i class="#"></i>How long is a day in jupiter?</h2>
          <p>
           A day in Jupiter takes about 10 hours. If someone could sit
            on Jupiter (which they can't because it has no solid surface),
             they would see the sunrise every five hours. And during the 
             five-hour nights, they would surely spot one, or several, 
             of its 75 moons.
