          <h1>Mars</h1>
          <p>
            Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet.
             It's red because of rusty iron in the ground. 
             Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, 
             volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very 
             thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, 
             and argon

          <h2><i class="#"></i> How big is mars?</h2>
          <p>
            Mars is around two times smaller than Earth.
             It has an equatorial circumference of about 
             21,000 kilometres, and a radius (the distance 
             from the middle of its core to the surface) 
             of around 3,400 kilometres.

        <div class="box">
          <h2><i class="#"></i>How hot is mars?</h2>
          <p>
            Mars's thin atmosphere makes for extreme temperature differences on the planet.
             When the Sun's energy enters the atmosphere, it is not equally dispersed and
              easily escapes back out into space.The temperature ranges from around -153°C 
              at the poles to possible highs of 20°C elsewhere on the planet's surface.

        <div class="box">
          <h2><i class="#"></i>How long is a day in mars?</h2>
          <p>
            A day on Mars lasts 24.6 hours, comparable to a day on Earth.
             But its years are far longer than ours, at 687 Earth days
              per trip around the Sun.

          <h2><i class="#"></i> How far from the Sun is Mars?</h2>
          <p>
            Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, orbiting at
             an average of 228 million kilometres away from the star. 
             The planet moves at a speed of around 24 kilometres per second,
              making it slightly slower than Earth.
